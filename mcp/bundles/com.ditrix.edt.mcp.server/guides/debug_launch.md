Starts an EDT debug session for a 1C application. There are two ways to pick what to launch, plus an idempotency guard that prevents a second client over a session that is already alive.

## When to use

Use this to bring up a debuggable 1C session before setting breakpoints and stepping. For client-side code, launch a runtime-client config (spawns 1cv8c). For SERVER-side code (HTTP services, background jobs, scheduled jobs) you must use an 'Attach to 1C:Enterprise Debug Server' config — a runtime-client launch cannot hit those breakpoints. After it returns, use `debug_status` to inspect, `wait_for_break` to block until a breakpoint is hit, and `terminate_launch` to stop.

## Modes (choose ONE)

1. **launchConfigurationName** — start an existing EDT launch configuration by its EXACT name. Works for both runtime-client configs (spawns 1cv8c) AND Attach configs (attaches to ragent/rphost for server-side code). Does NOT require applicationId. This is the only mode that can start an Attach session.
2. **projectName + applicationId** — searches the runtime-client configs of that project for a match and launches it. Runtime-client only; cannot reach an Attach config. Get the applicationId from `get_applications`.

## Parameter details

- **launchConfigurationName** (string) — exact config name; if set, projectName and applicationId are ignored. Use `list_configurations` to find the name.
- **projectName** (string) — EDT project name; required when launchConfigurationName is absent.
- **applicationId** (string) — from `get_applications`; required in the projectName+applicationId mode.
- **updateBeforeLaunch** (boolean, default true) — run the EDT 'update database before launch' preflight. Ignored for Attach configs (nothing to update). The update analysis is shared with the YAXUnit tools: skip when already UPDATED, wait when BEING_UPDATED, otherwise incremental-update.

## Already-running guard

If a launch of the same configuration/application is still alive, the tool short-circuits with `alreadyRunning: true` and a `mode` field, and does NOT spawn a fresh client. This also covers a launch started in RUN mode (no debug target): the tool still detects it and refuses to start a second client over it. To force a clean restart (e.g. after code changes that require a new session), call `terminate_launch` first, then `debug_launch` again.

## Examples

- Runtime client by name: `launchConfigurationName="MyApp / ThinClient"`.
- Attach to debug server-side code: `launchConfigurationName="Attach to 1C:Enterprise Debug Server"`.
- Runtime client by project + app: `projectName="MyProject"`, `applicationId="<id from get_applications>"`.
- Skip the DB update: add `updateBeforeLaunch=false`.

## Notes

- Returns JSON. On success: `launchConfiguration`, `configurationType`, `attach`, `mode`, `project`/`applicationId` (when known), and a `message`.
- On a not-found config the error payload includes `availableConfigurations` (every debug-capable config: runtime client + attach), so you can pick a valid name.
- The launch goes through a direct `config.launch(DEBUG_MODE, null)` to avoid modal EDT dialogs that would block the MCP worker thread.

## Gotchas

- Attach is reachable ONLY via launchConfigurationName; projectName+applicationId never starts an Attach session.
- `alreadyRunning: true` is a success, not an error — don't retry it; terminate first if you truly need a fresh session.
- `updateBeforeLaunch` has no effect on Attach configs.
