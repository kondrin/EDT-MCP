Launches the 1C:Enterprise application with the `RunUnitTests` startup parameter, polls until the launch terminates or the polling window expires, then parses the JUnit XML report and returns a Markdown summary. The full Markdown report is also written to `report.md` next to `junit.xml` so you can read it directly from disk.

## When to use

Use after writing or changing test code to verify it. Prerequisites: an existing runtime-client launch configuration for the project/application, and the YAXUnit extension installed in the target infobase. Without YAXUnit no JUnit XML is produced and the tool returns an error.

## Parameter details

Two ways to identify the launch:

- `launchConfigurationName` (preferred) — the exact runtime-client config name from `list_configurations`. When set, `projectName` and `applicationId` are derived from it.
- `projectName` + `applicationId` — required together when `launchConfigurationName` is omitted. Get the application id from `get_applications`.

Optional test filters (each an array of names, AND-combined; a comma-separated string is also accepted):

- `extensions` — restrict to tests in these extensions.
- `modules` — restrict to these test modules.
- `tests` — individual tests in `Module.Method` format.

Control:

- `timeout` — polling window in seconds (default 60). See ## Polling and Pending.
- `updateBeforeLaunch` — auto-chain, default `true`. See ## Auto-chain.

## Polling and Pending

The tool polls for up to `timeout` seconds. If the launch finishes in that window it returns the parsed JUnit report. If the window expires while the launch is still running it returns **Pending** and does NOT terminate the launch. Call the tool again with the SAME arguments to keep waiting and fetch the result once the launch completes. A run key is derived from the config name plus the filter, so identical arguments reattach to the in-flight launch instead of starting a new one. A fresh report (under a few minutes old) is served from cache.

## Auto-chain (updateBeforeLaunch)

Default `true`: before spawning a new test launch, the tool politely terminates any live 1C client running this configuration and runs a silent database update — so EDT's launch delegate does not pop its modal 'Update database?' dialog that would otherwise block the MCP call. Set `false` to keep legacy behaviour (the delegate decides; the dialog may appear and block). If pre-launch preparation fails because a previous launch is stuck, call `terminate_launch` with `force=true` and retry.

## Debug mode (debug=true)

Pass `debug=true` to launch in DEBUG mode so breakpoints set with `set_breakpoint` trip. Then the tool does NOT poll (it ignores `timeout`): it returns a Markdown launch handle immediately and you call `wait_for_break` next. The full cycle:

```
set_breakpoint -> run_yaxunit_tests(debug=true) -> wait_for_break
  -> get_variables / evaluate_expression / step -> resume
```
Pin to ONE test (`tests`) so exactly one breakpoint trips. The deprecated `debug_yaxunit_tests` tool is a thin alias for this.

## Examples

Run all tests via a named config:

```json
{ "launchConfigurationName": "TestClient" }
```

Run by project + application, filtered to two modules:

```json
{ "projectName": "MyProject", "applicationId": "<id-from-get_applications>", "modules": ["Tests_Catalog", "Tests_Document"] }
```

Run a single test method with a longer window:

```json
{ "launchConfigurationName": "TestClient", "tests": "Tests_Catalog.CreateAndPost", "timeout": 180 }
```

## Notes

- Response type is Markdown; the report is also saved to `report.md` next to `junit.xml`.
- The temp/report directory is not deleted on completion so a later call can re-fetch it.
- Module and test names are 1C identifiers (programmatic `Name`), not synonyms.

## Gotchas

- A timeout returns **Pending**, not a failure — do not retry with different arguments; reuse the same ones so the run key matches.
- If no JUnit XML appears after the launch finishes, the YAXUnit extension is likely not installed in the infobase, or the filter matched no tests.
- The config must be a runtime-client launch configuration; other types are rejected.
