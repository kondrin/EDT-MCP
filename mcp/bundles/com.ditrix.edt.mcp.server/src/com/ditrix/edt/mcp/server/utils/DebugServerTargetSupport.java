/**
 * Bridges EDT's 1C-native debug-server targets (the ones a breakpoint actually
 * suspends on when code runs <em>server-side</em> during {@code debug_yaxunit_tests},
 * or that a user started from the EDT UI via "Debug As") into the generic Eclipse
 * debug model the MCP debug tools already speak.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 * When YAXUnit tests run on a file-mode standalone server (rphost) — or a debug
 * session is started directly from the EDT UI — a breakpoint trips on a debuggee
 * that EDT tracks through its own
 * {@code IRuntimeDebugClientTargetManager.listDebugTargets()} view, NOT through
 * the threads of the Eclipse {@link org.eclipse.debug.core.ILaunch} a runtime
 * client started. So {@code launch.getDebugTargets()[*].getThreads()} reports
 * {@code threadCount:0} and {@code suspended:false} even though the server is
 * really suspended on the breakpoint line. The other debug tools, which resolve
 * an {@code applicationId} to an Eclipse {@code ILaunch}, never see the suspend.
 *
 * <h2>The key fact that makes the bridge clean</h2>
 * The 1C-native debug model is <strong>not</strong> a separate model — it
 * implements the standard Eclipse debug interfaces (verified in the EDT 2025.2
 * Javadoc):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code IRuntimeDebugClientTarget extends org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IDebugTarget}
 *       (and {@code ISuspendResume}, {@code ITerminate})</li>
 *   <li>{@code IRuntimeDebugTargetThread extends org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IThread}
 *       (and {@code IStep}, {@code ISuspendResume})</li>
 *   <li>{@code IBslStackFrame extends org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IStackFrame}
 *       (and {@code IStep})</li>
 * </ul>
 * Therefore, once a server target is obtained, its threads/frames can be read,
 * resumed, stepped, inspected ({@code getVariables}) and evaluated against
 * through the very same Eclipse-interface code paths the existing tools use for
 * thin-client launches.
 *
 * <h2>What counts as a "server target"</h2>
 * The target manager creates an {@code IRuntimeDebugClientTarget} for EVERY
 * debug session — thin-client launches included — so the raw
 * {@code listDebugTargets()} view is NOT "the server targets". A target counts
 * as a server target ({@link #isServerTarget(IDebugTarget)}) only when the
 * launch-based machinery cannot serve it: it carries a live server-typed thread
 * (debug-mode standalone server), or no live Eclipse launch registered in the
 * launch manager resolves to it (UI-started "Debug As" sessions, rphost
 * debuggees). A thin client owned by a live registered launch waits event-driven
 * through the suspend registry and is deliberately excluded from
 * {@link #listServerTargets()} — but NOT from the duplicate-session detect
 * ({@link #findRuntimeClientDebugTarget}), which exists to find exactly such
 * client sessions and therefore scans the unfiltered enumeration.
 *
 * <h2>Reflection boundary</h2>
 * Only the <em>discovery</em> of the targets is reflective — obtaining the
 * {@code IRuntimeDebugClientTargetManager} (an OSGi service looked up by class
 * name in {@link Activator#getRuntimeDebugClientTargetManager()}) and calling
 * its {@code listDebugTargets()}. Each returned element is then cast straight to
 * {@link IDebugTarget}; from that point on no reflection is needed.
