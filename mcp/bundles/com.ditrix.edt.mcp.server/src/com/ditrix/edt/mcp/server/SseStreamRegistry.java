/**
 * Registry of the open server-initiated SSE streams (the standalone {@code GET}
 * {@code text/event-stream} connections per the MCP Streamable HTTP transport),
 * plus a {@link #broadcast} that pushes a JSON-RPC message to all of them.
 * <p>
 * This is how the server delivers notifications it originates — currently
 * {@code notifications/tools/list_changed} when {@code enable_toolset} changes the
 * visible toolset under progressive disclosure. A client only receives it if it
 * keeps a GET SSE stream open; clients that don't fall back to re-requesting
 * {@code tools/list} (the pull path that {@code enable_toolset} points them to).
 * <p>
 * Thread-safe: streams are added/removed from a concurrent set, and each stream's
 * writes (heartbeat from its own SSE thread, broadcasts from a request thread) are
 * serialized by the per-stream lock in {@link SseStream}.
