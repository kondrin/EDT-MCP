e2e tests for clean_project (kind: action).

What the tool does
------------------
clean_project triggers Eclipse "Project -> Clean" (CLEAN_BUILD) on one or all EDT
projects: it refreshes files from disk, clears ALL validation markers, waits for the
EDT project context to restart (STOPPED -> STARTED) and for derived-data
recomputation, then reports how many projects were cleaned. It is an ACTION tool:
it recomputes WORKSPACE state (validation markers, derived data, the in-memory
model) — it does NOT, and must NOT, rewrite the project's tracked source files. So
the correct on-disk assertion for a successful clean is assert_no_diff() on
TestConfiguration: the action is safe to run on the fixture precisely because it
touches workspace state, not the committed tree. (Reference: CleanProjectTool.java
phases 1-4; only project.refreshLocal + CLEAN_BUILD + waiters, no MDO/BSL writes.)

Response shape (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------
CleanProjectTool.getResponseType() == JSON, so the real payload lands in
Result.structured (NOT Result.text — for a JSON tool r.text is just a placeholder).
The success envelope (ToolResult.success().put(...)) is:
    {"success": true,
     "projectsCleaned": <int>,            # == len(projects)
     "projects": [ "<name>", ... ],       # the cleaned project names
     "message": "Clean and revalidation completed."}
On error the envelope is {"success": false, "error": "<message>"} and the protocol
layer marks the result isError; assert_error returns that error string.

Parameter shape (from CleanProjectTool.getInputSchema / execute)
----------------------------------------------------------------
There is exactly ONE parameter: projectName (string, OPTIONAL). Omitting it cleans
ALL open EDT projects (not an error — a real happy branch). There is NO enum, NO XOR
pair, and NO conditional-required parameter, so the "invalid enum" /
"mutually-exclusive" / "conditional-required" negatives from the matrix do not apply
here (documented, not skipped). The reachable negatives are driven entirely by the
project-state pre-check:

  - non-existent project -> the readiness pre-check is now
    ProjectStateChecker.buildingErrorOrNull(projectName), which refuses ONLY the
    transient BUILDING state and returns null for a missing/closed/unknown project.
    So a name absent from the workspace falls through to cleanProject(), where
    ProjectContext.of(name).exists()==false returns the actionable, value-naming
    "Project not found: <name>" error (see test_nonexistent_project_*).
  - empty-string projectName -> NOT an error: extractStringArgument returns "" ,
    `projectName != null && !projectName.isEmpty()` is false, the readiness check is
    skipped, and the tool falls through to the "clean ALL projects" branch (the same
    branch as the omitted-param happy path). This is asserted as a happy branch, not
    a negative — documenting that "" behaves like "omitted", not like a bad name.

ACTION-TOOL SAFETY (why there is a real happy path here, unlike import/update)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
clean_project only clears/recomputes markers; it cannot corrupt the committed
fixture. So a happy call IS run, and the test proves the fixture tree is unchanged
afterwards (assert_no_diff). This is distinct from the destructive action tools
(import_configuration_from_xml, update_database) whose happy path WOULD overwrite the
fixture / mutate the infobase and is therefore intentionally never exercised; those
tools test only their negative/sentinel matrix. clean_project has no such hazard.

Mutation thinking
-----------------
Each test fails if the tool were broken: a no-op clean that returned the wrong
envelope (no success flag / wrong message / desynced count) fails the happy asserts;
a clean that silently rewrote a tracked file fails assert_no_diff; a tool that
stopped rejecting an unknown project fails assert_error.
