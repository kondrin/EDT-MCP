e2e tests for export_configuration_to_xml (kind: action).

WHAT THE TOOL DOES (from ExportConfigurationToXmlTool.java):
  Wraps the EDT action "Export -> Configuration to XML Files" — dumps an open EDT
  configuration project to a DIRECTORY of XML source files (1C DumpConfigToFiles
  format) by calling, via reflection,
  IExportConfigurationFilesApi.exportProject(String projectName, Path outputPath).

  Response type is MARKDOWN (getResponseType() == MARKDOWN), so the payload is in
  r.text (NOT r.structured). On success the FrontMatter carries:
      ---
      tool: export_configuration_to_xml
      status: success
      project: <projectName>
      outputPath: <normalized ABSOLUTE path>
      [outsideWorkspace: true]   # only when outputPath is outside the EDT workspace
      ---
      # Configuration exported to XML files
      - Project: <projectName>
      - Output path: <abs>
      [> Note: outputPath is outside the EDT workspace; ...]

  Required params (BOTH guarded by JsonUtils.requireArguments("projectName",
  "outputPath"), projectName checked FIRST):
      projectName  -> missing/blank => "projectName is required"
      outputPath   -> missing/blank => "outputPath is required"

  outputPath handling in execute():
      - normalized to an absolute path (Paths.get(..).toAbsolutePath().normalize())
      - if it EXISTS but is NOT a directory (a plain file) =>
            "outputPath exists but is not a directory: <abs>"
      - otherwise Files.createDirectories(outputPath) (a missing dir is created;
        that is NOT an error)
      - export writes to ANY absolute path; a path outside the workspace is flagged
        (outsideWorkspace: true) but NOT rejected.

  Error/sentinel paths (env-dependent):
      - CLI API plugin com._1c.g5.v8.dt.cli.api absent (Activator returns null) =>
            "IExportConfigurationFilesApi is not available. Required EDT plugin
             com._1c.g5.v8.dt.cli.api is not installed."
      - exportProject throws (e.g. unknown/closed project — there is NO early
        project-existence guard; it falls through to the reflective invoke) =>
            "Export failed: <cause message>"
      - signature drift => "CLI API mismatch: <msg>"

ACTION-TOOL SAFETY (why the happy path is safe here):
  export_configuration_to_xml writes XML to the outputPath ARGUMENT, NOT into the
  project tree. The happy test exports to a fresh directory under the OS TEMP dir
  (tempfile.mkdtemp), i.e. OUTSIDE this repo, so it can NEVER create files inside
  TestConfiguration/ or dirty the git working tree. Every test still asserts
  assert_no_diff() on TestConfiguration — exporting the model to an external dir
  must not mutate the source project. The temp dir is removed in a finally block
  (it is outside the repo, so it has zero effect on the git fixture either way).

ENVIRONMENT ROBUSTNESS:
  Whether com._1c.g5.v8.dt.cli.api is installed in THIS EDT is environment-
  dependent (like LanguageTool for the translation tools). So the happy path has
  two correct branches:
    - API present  -> real success contract (FrontMatter status + XML files land
                      in the temp dir) — mutation-sensitive: a no-op / wrong status
                      / empty output dir fails it.
    - API absent   -> the clear, actionable "...is not available. ...not installed."
                      sentinel — asserted via assert_error_quality.
  Both branches are real behaviour and both fail if the tool is broken.
