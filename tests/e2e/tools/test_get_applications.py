e2e tests for get_applications (kind: read).

What the tool does
------------------
get_applications enumerates the *applications* (infobases) registered for an EDT
project via IApplicationManager.getApplications(project). Each application carries
an id, name, type id, and update state; the tool also reports the default
application id. The returned application *id* is the round-trip input that
update_database and debug_launch consume (see the tool description) — so this is a
discovery/read tool, never a mutator.

Response shape (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------
GetApplicationsTool.getResponseType() == JSON, so the real payload lands in
Result.structured (NOT Result.text — for a JSON tool r.text is just a "Done"/error
placeholder). The success envelope is:
    {"success": true,
     "project": "<name>",
     "applications": [ {"id","name","type","updateState","updateStateDescription",
                        ["requiredVersion"]}, ... ],
     "count": <int>,                       # == len(applications)
     ["defaultApplicationId": "<id>"],     # only when a default exists
     ["message": "No applications found for project"]}  # only on the empty branch
On error the envelope is {"success": false, "error": "<message>"} and the protocol
layer marks the result isError; assert_error returns that error string.

Why the happy path does NOT assert a fixed application id/name
--------------------------------------------------------------
Applications/infobases are NOT part of the git-tracked TestConfiguration/ tree —
they live in the EDT *workspace* (.metadata) and are created at runtime when an
infobase is registered. The fixture checkout has none guaranteed. The set of
applications is therefore environment-dependent and asserting a fixed id would be
flaky. Instead the happy path asserts the tool's STRUCTURAL INVARIANTS, which break
if the tool is broken regardless of how many applications exist:
  - the JSON envelope is present and well-formed (success=true, project echoed),
  - "applications" is a list and "count" is an int,
  - count == len(applications)   (the tool derives count from applications.size()),
  - if applications exist, every entry carries the round-trip "id" + "name" the
    sibling tools (update_database / debug_launch) require,
  - if NO applications exist, the tool emits the explicit empty-branch contract
    (count==0, applications==[], the "No applications found" message) rather than
    garbage or a crash.
A read tool must never touch the project tree, so every test ends with
assert_no_diff().

Inherited applications for a DEPENDENT project (issue #203)
-----------------------------------------------------------
An external-objects (V8ExternalObjectsNature) or extension project has NO
applications of its own — both share the EDT supertype IDependentProject, whose
getParentProject() points at the BASE configuration that owns the infobases. The
tool therefore RE-RUNS the lookup against the parent when the named (dependent)
project has none, and surfaces the base project's applications. On that inherited
branch the envelope keeps echoing the NAMED (dependent) project in "project" and
adds a NEW field "inheritedFromProject" == the base project name. The field is
emitted ONLY on the inherited branch; a plain Configuration project (never an
IDependentProject) never carries it, so its envelope stays byte-identical.

This is exercised by test_dependent_project_inherits_base_applications below. It is
ENVIRONMENT-TOLERANT in the SAME spirit as the happy path's count==0 handling: it
only asserts the inherited contract when a dependent fixture bound to a base WITH
applications is actually present in the workspace (applications live in the EDT
workspace, not the git fixture, so neither the dependent project nor its base is
guaranteed to have any). When no such fixture/application exists the inherited
assertions are skipped, so the case never fails in a headless CI workspace.

Parameter shape (from GetApplicationsTool.getInputSchema / execute)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
There is exactly ONE parameter: projectName (string, REQUIRED). There is NO enum,
NO XOR pair, and NO conditional-required parameter on this tool, so the
"invalid enum" / "mutually-exclusive" / "conditional-required" negatives from the
matrix do not apply here (documented, not skipped). The reachable negatives are:
  - missing required projectName  -> requireArgument -> "projectName is required"
  - empty-string projectName      -> same guard (extractStringArgument -> isEmpty)
  - non-existent project          -> the readiness pre-check
    (ProjectStateChecker.buildingErrorOrNull) returns null for a non-building name,
    so control falls through to getApplications, where ProjectContext.of(name)
    has exists()==false and the tool returns "Project not found: <name>".

    ENVIRONMENT-TOLERANT (issue #203): applications live in the EDT workspace, not the
    git fixture, so neither a dependent project nor its base is guaranteed to have any.
    The inherited branch only fires when a dependent project's OWN application set is
    empty AND its base owns applications. We therefore:
      - discover whether the canonical dependent fixture is present (the extension
        fixture TestConfiguration.tests == TESTS_PROJECT, base = PROJECT); we pin to it
