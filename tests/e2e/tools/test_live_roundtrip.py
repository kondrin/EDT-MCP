"""
ATTENDED live-infobase ROUND-TRIP suite — the part of the debug/profiling/YAXUnit
coverage that a headless run cannot reach.

Why this file is special
------------------------
Every OTHER e2e file asserts the realistic *no-infobase* contract: in CI there is
no running infobase, no YAXUnit engine, and no debug session, so the genuine happy
path for those runtime tools is an actionable SENTINEL (see test_run_yaxunit_tests,
test_wait_for_break, test_terminate_launch, ...). Those files fully cover argument
validation, error quality, and the no-session branches.

What they CANNOT cover is a real END-TO-END round-trip against a live infobase:
  1. a real YAXUnit run -> real junit.xml -> parsed Markdown counts;
  2. a real breakpoint SUSPEND -> inspect (get_variables / evaluate_expression)
     -> RESUME;
  3. a launch/session id MINTED by one tool and CONSUMED by its siblings
     (debug_status / terminate_launch; start_profiling -> get_profiling_results
     -> stop_profiling).

Those chains need a running infobase + a runtime-client launch configuration + the
YAXUnit engine (YAxUnit.cfe) loaded — heavy, stateful, and absent from CI. So this
whole file is GATED behind requires_live_infobase(): each test SKIPS (E2ESkip, NOT
a failure) unless EDT_MCP_LIVE_INFOBASE=1. A normal `run_all.py` therefore reports
them as skipped and stays green; an attended operator runs them explicitly:

    EDT_MCP_LIVE_INFOBASE=1 python tests/e2e/run_all.py --project TestConfiguration \
        --filter test_live_

Preconditions for the live run (the attended operator owns these):
  - EDT open on the TestConfiguration workspace, MCP up on :8765;
  - a runtime-client launch config named LIVE_LAUNCH_CONFIG
    ("TestConfiguration Thin Client" by default) pointing at the infobase;
  - the infobase has the YAXUnit engine loaded and the "tests" extension applied
    (run update_database once if the extension changed).

Isolation / teardown
---------------------
The suite drives REAL launches. Every test, at BOTH ends, terminates its own launch
config (targeted by name — not a blanket all=true kill, which can disturb EDT's
shared infobase-connection registry) and waits for the infobase to go quiet, so the
next test starts clean. Each debug test passes the launch's minted applicationId
EXPLICITLY to wait_for_break (rather than relying on single-launch auto-resolution),
so an async-starting launch is awaited, not missed. None of these tools touch the
git-tracked project tree — but a live EDT may incidentally re-touch a metadata .mdo
with a CRLF normalization while updating the infobase, so each test ends with
assert_no_substantive_diff() (tolerant of a whitespace/line-ending-only touch, but
still failing a real source content change or a new/deleted file).

Fixture inventory (TestConfiguration.tests extension, English module file names):
  CommonModule tests_SampleTests exports YAXUnit tests; TwoPlusTwoIsFour asserts
  `2 + 2 == 4` on a single line (the breakpoint target). All 8 registered cases pass.
