e2e tests for get_translation_project_info (kind: read).

The tool wraps LanguageTool's IProjectInformationApi (via reflection) and returns
MARKDOWN (getResponseType() == MARKDOWN), so the payload is in r.text
(NOT r.structured). The body has two fixed sections plus a FrontMatter header:

    ---
    tool: get_translation_project_info
    project: <projectName>
    storagesCount: <int>
    providersCount: <int>
    ---
    ## Storages

    - <storage id>        (or "(none)" when no dictionary storage is attached)

    ## Translation providers

    - <provider id>       (or "(none)" when LanguageTool exposes none)

ENVIRONMENT DEPENDENCY (documented, not a bug):
  This tool REQUIRES EDT with LanguageTool installed. Activator.getProjectInformationApi()
  returns null when LanguageTool is absent, and execute() then returns
  ToolResult.error("LanguageTool IProjectInformationApi is not available. Install
  LanguageTool in EDT."). The TestConfiguration fixture also has NO dictionary storage
  attached, so even WITH LanguageTool the Storages list is legitimately empty ("(none)",
  storagesCount: 0). The happy-path test therefore asserts the STRUCTURAL contract that
  holds whenever the API is available (the two section headings + the FrontMatter tool
  tag), which still fails if the tool no-ops / renders the wrong sections / swaps the
  body, rather than asserting a specific storage/provider id that the fixture does not
  guarantee. See GetTranslationProjectInfoTool.java for the exact branches.

Real error paths in GetTranslationProjectInfoTool.execute():
  - missing projectName      -> "projectName is required"                  (JsonUtils.requireArgument)
  - project not found/closed -> "Project not found or closed: <name>"      (ProjectContext.isOpen() false)
  - not an EDT project        -> "Not an EDT project: <name>"               (dtProject == null)
  - LanguageTool absent       -> "LanguageTool IProjectInformationApi is not available. ..."

Fixture inventory used (TestConfiguration, English Names): the project itself
(projectName "TestConfiguration"); no dictionary storage attached.
