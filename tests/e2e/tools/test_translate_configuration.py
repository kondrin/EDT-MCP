e2e tests for translate_configuration (kind: action).

translate_configuration runs EDT's "Translation -> Translate configuration"
action. Under the hood it invokes LanguageTool's public CLI
`ISynchronizeProjectApi.synchronizeProject(IDtProject, List<String> languages)`
via reflection, then waits for derived data. It returns MARKDOWN
(getResponseType() == MARKDOWN), so the payload is in r.text (NOT r.structured).

The success body is a FrontMatter document:

    ---
    tool: translate_configuration
    project: <projectName>
    targetLanguages: <comma-joined codes>
    status: success
    ---
    Translate configuration completed.

REQUIRED PARAMETERS (TranslateConfigurationTool.getInputSchema / .execute):
  - projectName     (string)        -> JsonUtils.requireArgument
  - targetLanguages (string array)  -> JsonUtils.extractArrayArgument; rejected
                                       when null/empty with its own guard

execute() guard order (this dictates which error wins, and is why each negative
test below isolates exactly ONE bad field):
  1. requireArgument(projectName)        -> "projectName is required"
  2. targetLanguages null/empty          -> "targetLanguages is required (e.g. [\"en\"])"
  3. ctx.exists() false                  -> "Project not found: <name>"
  4. ctx.isOpen() false                  -> "Project is closed: <name>"
  5. ProjectStateChecker BUILDING        -> (building "...Please wait and retry."
                                            only while derived data is building;
                                            missing/closed fall through to guards 3-4)
  6. dtProject == null                   -> "Not an EDT project: <name>"
  7. getSynchronizeProjectApi() == null  -> "LanguageTool ISynchronizeProjectApi
                                             is not available. Install LanguageTool in EDT."
  8. happy: synchronizeProject(...) -> waitForDerivedData -> FrontMatter status: success

ENVIRONMENT DEPENDENCY (documented, not a bug — mirrors get_translation_project_info):
  This action REQUIRES EDT with LanguageTool installed. In THIS EDT LanguageTool
  is NOT installed, so Activator.getSynchronizeProjectApi() returns null and the
  happy call returns the clear, actionable "not available" sentinel (guard #7).
  The happy-path test is therefore ENV-ROBUST: it supplies a fully valid call
  (real open project + a real target language) and accepts EITHER
    - the real success contract (LanguageTool present), OR
    - the LanguageTool-unavailable sentinel (LanguageTool absent),
  asserting the contract of whichever branch the live server actually took. Both
  branches are mutation-sensitive (a no-op / wrong document fails success; a
  vague/blank error fails the sentinel).

ACTION-TOOL SAFETY (why there is no "real mutating happy path" here):
  Even WITH LanguageTool, translate_configuration regenerates *translated
  artifacts* from dictionary storages bound to the project. The TestConfiguration
  fixture has NO dictionary storage attached (same as get_translation_project_info,
  storagesCount: 0), so there is nothing to translate; a real run does not write a
  deterministic, fixture-committed change we could assert without first corrupting
  the fixture by attaching a storage. Therefore EVERY test here asserts
  assert_no_diff() on TestConfiguration: the action must NOT alter the committed
  project source tree. (If a future fixture attaches a storage and LanguageTool is
  installed, add a dedicated mutating-happy test that diffs the regenerated
  artifact — do not relax these guardrails.)

Fixture inventory used (TestConfiguration, English Names): the project itself
(projectName "TestConfiguration"). Catalog.Catalog is reused only as a known
NON-project name to prove the "Project not found" branch echoes the bad value.
