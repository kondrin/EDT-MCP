# modify_metadata

Set properties of a metadata node (object or member, including a FORM member - item / attribute / command) addressed by a 1C full-name FQN, as properties=[{name, value, language?}]. Each property is validated (it must be assignable, and an enum value must be one of the allowed literals) with an actionable error. Move/reorder a FORM ITEM with the 'parent' (a group name, 'AutoCommandBar' for the form's command bar, or the form name for the form root) and/or 'position' ('first'/'last'/'before:<name>'/'after:<name>'/index) properties. REBIND a form event handler's procedure with a 'procedure' property on a Handler FQN, or re-point a Button at a different form command with a 'command' property. Set a StyleItem's value with a 'value' property: a Color {value:{color:{red:255,green:0,blue:0}}} (or {color:'auto'}) or a Font {value:{font:{faceName:'Arial',height:12,bold:true}}}. Give a form list FORM ATTRIBUTE a custom dynamic-list query with a 'queryText' property (and 'customQuery' true/false, plus an optional 'mainTable' object FQN): this turns the attribute into a DynamicList and lets EDT auto-fill the available fields from the query (no manual XML; output a column with create_metadata Field dataPath 'List.<field>'). Discover assignable properties + allowed values with get_metadata_details(assignable:true). To rename, use rename_metadata_object. Full parameters and examples: call get_tool_guide('modify_metadata').

## Parameters
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| projectName | yes | string | EDT project name (required). |
| fqn | yes | string | Full-name FQN of the node to modify (required), e.g. 'Catalog.Products' or 'Catalog.Products.Attribute.Weight' (type / kind tokens may be English or Russian; the Name parts are the programmatic Name). |
| properties | yes | array | Properties to set, as [{name, value, language?}] (required, at least one). 'name' is the property name (e.g. 'comment', 'synonym', 'indexing'); 'value' is the new value; 'language' is the code for a synonym (default: config default). |
| normalizeYo | — | boolean | Normalize the Russian letter 'ё'->'е' / 'Ё'->'Е' in localized-string values (synonym / title) and in the 'comment' property (default true). Matches the 1C standard mdo-ru-name-unallowed-letter. Other free-text strings can be identifier-like (e.g. XDTOPackage.namespace is a URI) and always keep the supplied value. Set false to keep 'ё' exactly as supplied everywhere. |

## Guide
Sets one or more properties of a metadata node addressed by a 1C full-name FQN (a top object or a member: attribute / tabular section / dimension / resource / enum value), then force-exports the owning top object to its `.mdo`. Replaces the former set_metadata_property (which set only Comment / Synonym); this tool sets any assignable scalar / boolean / integer / enum / synonym property.

## Validation (errors are help)
- A property that is NOT assignable on this node is rejected with the list of assignable properties - discover them with get_metadata_details(assignable:true).
- An ENUM value that is not one of the allowed literals is rejected WITH the allowed values; a non-boolean for a boolean property, or a non-integer for an integer property, is rejected too. Nothing is written unless EVERY property validates.

## Parameter details
- `projectName` (required) - EDT project name.
- `fqn` (required) - full-name FQN of the node.
- `properties` (required) - array of `{name, value, language?}`. `name` is the property name; `value` the new value; `language` the CODE for a synonym (default: config default).
- `normalizeYo` (optional, default true) - normalize the Russian letter `ё`->`е` / `Ё`->`Е` in localized-string values (synonym / title) and in the `comment` property (matches the 1C standard `mdo-ru-name-unallowed-letter`). Other free-text strings can be identifier-like (e.g. `XDTOPackage.namespace` is a URI) and always keep the supplied value. Set `false` to keep `ё` exactly as supplied everywhere. The result lists the rewritten properties under `normalized`.

## Not supported here
- `name` (rename): refused - use rename_metadata_object, which cascades the rename across BSL code, forms and metadata.

## Setting the data type
The `type` property takes a STRUCTURED value `{types:[{kind, ...}]}`. Primitive kinds String / Number / Boolean / Date carry inline qualifiers (length; precision / scale / nonNegative; fractions = DateTime | Date | Time). A reference is `{kind:'Ref', ref:'Type.Name'}` (or `{kind:'CatalogRef', ref:'Name'}`). The list may mix several (a composite type).

## Setting an object reference
A reference property to another metadata object is set by FQN: a SINGLE reference (e.g. `chartOfAccounts` on an AccountingRegister) takes `value:'Type.Name'`; a LIST reference (e.g. a Subsystem's `content`) takes `value:['Type.Name', ...]` and REPLACES the whole list (an empty array `[]` clears it). The target must be a top-level object whose type matches; get_metadata_details(assignable:true) shows the allowed target type. Structured content with per-item flags (e.g. a common attribute's content), and references whose target is a member (e.g. a default form), are not set here yet.

## Setting a StyleItem value (Color / Font)
A StyleItem (created generically with create_metadata) has no value yet; set its `value` property to a STRUCTURED object with EITHER a `color` OR a `font` member (not both). The style item's `type` (Color / Font) is set automatically to match the value.
- Color (explicit RGB): `{name:'value', value:{color:{red:255, green:0, blue:0}}}` - each component 0-255.
- Color (automatic): `{name:'value', value:{color:'auto'}}` - the platform automatic color.
- Font: `{name:'value', value:{font:{faceName:'Arial', height:12, bold:true, italic:false, underline:false, strikeout:false}}}` - at least one of faceName / height / bold / italic / underline / strikeout is required; height is a positive integer.
get_metadata_details renders the assigned value under a `Value` section (Style Type + Color `RGB(r, g, b)` / `Auto`, or the Font face / height / flags).

## Form members
A FORM member is addressed like its create FQN: `Catalog.X.Form.F.<Kind>.Name` (or `CommonForm.F.<Kind>.Name`), Kind = Attribute / Command / Field / Button / Group / Decoration / Table. The same assignable properties apply: an item's `title` (bilingual; defaults to the config language when `language` is omitted), `visible`, `readOnly` (fields / groups / tables only) and any other assignable scalar / boolean / enum the item carries. NB `type` is context-dependent: on a form ATTRIBUTE it aliases the data `valueType` (same `{types:[...]}` shape as an mdclass attribute); on a form FIELD / Button / Decoration it is the display-kind ENUM (InputField / LabelField / ...). A wrong property name is rejected WITH the member's assignable list. The form item `id` cannot be set (auto-allocated). The change persists to the form's `Form.form` on disk.

## Rebinding a form event handler / a button's command
Two form links are not ordinary assignable properties and have their own rebind paths (both force-export the `Form.form`):
- REBIND a handler's procedure: address the EXISTING handler by its FQN `Catalog.X.Form.F.Handler.<Event>` (form-level), `Catalog.X.Form.F.<ItemKind>.<ItemName>.Handler.<Event>` (item-level) or `Catalog.X.Form.F.Command.<Name>.Handler.Action` (a command's Action) and pass a `procedure` property with the new BSL procedure name. This only re-points an existing handler; to BIND a new event use create_metadata, to remove it delete_metadata. A handler FQN accepts no other property.
- RE-POINT a button at a different (existing) form command: address the Button by its FQN `Catalog.X.Form.F.Button.<Name>` and pass a `command` property naming an existing form command (the button's `commandName` targets a FormCommand, a form-model object, so it is rebound here rather than via a generic reference). The command must already exist; a `command` change cannot be combined with other property changes in one call.

## Moving / reordering a form item
A FORM ITEM (a field / group / decoration / button / table - anything in the form's items tree) is RE-PARENTED and/or REORDERED with two move properties on `properties`:
- `parent` - the destination: an existing container name (a group, a table) to nest the item inside, the special `AutoCommandBar` token for the form's command bar (`MyTable.AutoCommandBar` for a table's own bar), or the FORM name (or an empty string) to move it to the form ROOT. Omit `parent` to keep the current parent (a pure reorder).
- `position` - the destination order among the children: `first`, `last`, `before:<siblingName>`, `after:<siblingName>`, or a 0-based integer INDEX. The integer index is the desired FINAL position "as you see it" (reordering within the same container is not off-by-one). Omit `position` to append to the end of the destination. Out-of-range handling is deliberately asymmetric: an integer index past the last position is CLAMPED to the end (tolerant, like list APIs), while `before:`/`after:` naming an unknown sibling is an ERROR (an explicit sibling reference asserts the form's current structure, so a stale name must surface instead of being silently re-interpreted).
A move is structural, so it CANNOT be combined with ordinary property changes in the same call (move first, then modify). `parent`/`position` apply to an ITEM only - a form Attribute / Command is not positioned. The same placement rules as create apply (e.g. no decorations in command bars); a button's CommandBarButton/UsualButton type re-derives when it crosses a bar boundary; the designer auto-children (tooltips / context menus / command bars) are not movable. A group cannot be moved into ITSELF or one of its own descendants (a cycle); an ambiguous / missing item or an unknown parent is a clean error. The move force-exports the form's `Form.form` to disk; the result carries a `destination` describing where the item ended up.

## Setting a dynamic-list custom query
A list / choice form shows its rows through a **dynamic list** form attribute. To give it a CUSTOM query (e.g. a multilingual name from a common attribute, a calculated column, or an in-query filter) set the query on that ATTRIBUTE - addressed `Catalog.X.Form.ListForm.Attribute.<Name>`:
- `queryText` - the 1C query, e.g. `SELECT Ref, Description AS Description FROM Catalog.Products`. Setting it turns the attribute into a dynamic list (if it is not one already) and implies `customQuery=true`.
- `customQuery` - `true` to use the custom `queryText`, `false` to switch the dynamic list back to its automatic main-table query (the `queryText` is kept but ignored while false).
- `mainTable` (optional) - the FQN of the object the list reads from, e.g. `Document.Order` / `Catalog.Products`. It is resolved to the object's main-table view; setting it enables the list's available-table fields and dynamic data reading. The list is valid without it (the query's FROM defines the source).

When the attribute is not yet a dynamic list it is converted: a `DynamicList` value type and a dynamic-list ext-info are created, the form's main attribute is set when it has none, and `autoFillAvailableFields` is turned on so EDT derives the available `<fields>` from the query - you do NOT author a DCS `<fields>` block. Create the bare attribute first (`create_metadata` with `...Form.ListForm.Attribute.List`), then set its query here. **Output a column** with `create_metadata` for a form Field bound to `dataPath` `List.<field>` (e.g. `List.Number`), where `<field>` is a query select field; the Field shows that query column in the list table. The query props are structural, so they cannot be combined with other property changes in one call (set the query first, then make other changes). A non-existent attribute or a malformed FQN is a clean error. The change force-exports the form's `Form.form` to disk; verify with get_project_errors (an invalid query is reported by the platform's dynamic-list validation). Property names are bilingual: ru `ТекстЗапроса` / `ПроизвольныйЗапрос` / `ОсновнаяТаблица`.

## Examples
- Move a field into a group: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ItemForm.Field.Price', properties:[{name:'parent', value:'PriceGroup'}]}`
- Move a button into the command bar: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ItemForm.Button.Print', properties:[{name:'parent', value:'AutoCommandBar'}]}`
- Reorder a field to the top of its container: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ItemForm.Field.Price', properties:[{name:'position', value:'first'}]}`
- Move a field back to the form root, after another item: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ItemForm.Field.Price', properties:[{name:'parent', value:'ItemForm'}, {name:'position', value:'after:Description'}]}`
- Set a comment: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products', properties:[{name:'comment', value:'Goods'}]}`
- Set a synonym: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products', properties:[{name:'synonym', value:'Goods', language:'en'}]}`
- Set an enum on an attribute: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Attribute.Weight', properties:[{name:'indexing', value:'Index'}]}`
- Set a type: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Attribute.Weight', properties:[{name:'type', value:{types:[{kind:'Number', precision:10, scale:2}]}}]}`
- Set a list reference: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Subsystem.Sales', properties:[{name:'content', value:['Catalog.Products', 'Document.Order']}]}`
- Hide a form item: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ItemForm.Field.Price', properties:[{name:'visible', value:false}]}`
- Set a form attribute's type: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ItemForm.Attribute.Total', properties:[{name:'type', value:{types:[{kind:'Number', precision:10, scale:2}]}}]}`
- Give a list form a custom dynamic-list query: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ListForm.Attribute.List', properties:[{name:'queryText', value:'SELECT Ref, Description AS Description FROM Catalog.Products'}, {name:'customQuery', value:true}]}`
- Set the dynamic list's main table: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ListForm.Attribute.List', properties:[{name:'mainTable', value:'Catalog.Products'}]}`
- Switch a dynamic list back to its automatic query: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ListForm.Attribute.List', properties:[{name:'customQuery', value:false}]}`
- Rebind an item-level handler's procedure: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ItemForm.Field.Price.Handler.OnChange', properties:[{name:'procedure', value:'PriceOnChange'}]}`
- Re-point a button at another command: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'Catalog.Products.Form.ItemForm.Button.Go', properties:[{name:'command', value:'Refresh'}]}`
- Set a style item to a red color: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'StyleItem.MyColor', properties:[{name:'value', value:{color:{red:255, green:0, blue:0}}}]}`
- Set a style item to the automatic color: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'StyleItem.MyColor', properties:[{name:'value', value:{color:'auto'}}]}`
- Set a style item to a font: `{projectName:'P', fqn:'StyleItem.MyFont', properties:[{name:'value', value:{font:{faceName:'Arial', height:12, bold:true}}}]}`

## Result
JSON with `action='modified'`, the normalized `fqn`, the `applied` property names, `persisted`, and (when the ё->е normalization rewrote anything) the list of `normalized` properties. A move additionally returns `destination` (where the moved item ended up, e.g. `group 'Main' at index 1`).

## Reverting (no undo)
There is no automatic undo: to revert a change, call modify_metadata again with the previous value (read the current value first with get_metadata_details). modify_metadata is intentionally NOT confirm-gated because it is reversible that way; only the destructive / high-blast-radius writes (delete_metadata, rename_metadata_object, update_database, delete_project) are gated with a confirm-preview.
